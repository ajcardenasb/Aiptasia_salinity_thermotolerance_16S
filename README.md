# Bacterial diversity during salinity-conveyed thermotolerance in the coral model Aiptasia

This repository contains the scripts used to analyze data and create figures for the manuscript “Salinity-conveyed thermotolerance in the coral model Aiptasia is accompanied by distinct changes of the bacterial microbiome”.


## Workflow

1. Identification and removal of contaminant OTUs, and overal taxonomic profiles were done using the script `Aipasia_salinity_barplots.R`

2. Ordination plots and PERMANOVAs were done using the script `Aiptasia_salinity_ordination_and_Permanovas.R`

3. Alpha diversity indexes were calculated using the script `Aiptasia_salinity_AlphaDiversity.R`

4. The Similarity Percentage analysis (SIMPER) was used to identify OTUs that best discriminated between salinities and temperatures as described in the script `Aiptasia_salinity_SIMPER.R`
